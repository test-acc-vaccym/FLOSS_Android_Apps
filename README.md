I use Android phones for 5 years but I'm interested in FLOSS development for only 1 year. Conlusion? `FLOSS apps` are very important for the community (not only for Android OS) but they are often underestimated or not well known.
Many awesome FLOSS apps are available for `Android` and they well deserve to be better known! Yes, there's a world behind Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft,...

> If you want to discover new free/libre and open source apps, give a try to the below apps! I'll add new apps as soon as I try good ones.

> If you want to suggest new apps, feel free to share your list! :innocent:

> If you want to keep using proprietary apps, go away!!! :japanese_goblin:

## DIFFERENCES COMPARED TO F-DROID
Several apps listed here are not available on F-Droid. F-Droid is a `FLOSS app store` so they decline any open source apps that don't respect their **Inclusion Policy**. By the way, some FLOSS apps aren't available on F-Droid (lack of time or big apps to maintain).
I also tested more than 80% of the apps I posted in this thread so this is more or less my recommended app list.
